# Backend API URL
# This is where the frontend will send API requests

# Development (default):
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Production examples:
# If using Railway for backend:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-app.railway.app

# If using Render:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com

# If backend and frontend are on the same domain (e.g., using Vercel rewrites):
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=

# ================================
# NOTES FOR DEPLOYMENT
# ================================
# 1. Never commit your actual .env file to Git
# 2. Copy this file to .env and fill in your backend URL
# 3. For Vercel deployment:
#    - Add VITE_BACKEND_URL as an environment variable in Vercel dashboard
#    - Set it to your production backend URL
# 4. The VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to expose the variable to the browser
